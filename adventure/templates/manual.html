      <h2><img src="{% static "images/ravenmore/128/tome.png" %}"> Adventurer's Manual</h2>

      <p>Eamon is a combination of a text-based interactive fiction game (like Adventure, Zork, etc.) and a fantasy role-playing game. Players create a character, journey on various adventures, and interact with the game world using English-like commands. Players explore pre-mapped adventures, fighting vicious and often humorous foes, collecting loot, and locating keys, magic items, or other special objects which allow them to proceed on through the plot.</p>

      <h3>Basic Character Attributes</h3>

      <p>All new characters start at a beginning level, with a bit of gold and basic weapon knowledge. But, they are also a diverse group with different strengths and weaknesses. Three prime statistics (or "attributes") describe the general strengths and weaknesses of a newly created character. These are called <strong>Hardiness</strong>, <strong>Agility</strong> and <strong>Charisma</strong>. Characters may also learn several magic spells, and other skills like how to fight effectively while wearing heavy armor.</p>

      <p>While a character's combat and magic skills will increase with use, the three basic physical attributes cannot be changed through "natural" means. However, Eamon is a magical world, and ways may be found to increase (and sometimes decrease) a character's attributes in certain adventures.</p>

      <p>For the sake of example in the next few sections, it will be assumed that a new character named "Hedric the Horrible" has just been created, with a Hardiness of thirteen, an Agility of twenty and a Charisma of five.</p>

      <h4>HARDINESS</h4>

      <p>A character's Hardiness has two major effects. It determines the player's hit points, and how much the player can carry.</p>

      <p>The player's maximum hit points are the same as his or her hardiness. Hedric the Horrible, with his hardiness of 13, can take 13 points of damage.</p>

      <p>Weight of items ("artifacts") in Eamon is measured in units called "gronds." A smaller unit called the "do" is 1/10 of a grond, but this is seldom used in modern times. A player may carry artifacts weighing ten times his or her hardiness in gronds. So Hedric can carry weight of 130 gronds. This includes all his weapons and armor. For comparison, a sword might weigh 5 gronds, while a set of plate armor might weigh 30 gronds.</p>

      <h4>AGILITY</h4>

      <p>Agility is mostly a combat stat. A character with high agility is more likely to strike an opponent and also to dodge attacks from that opponent. Some adventures may use the character's Hardiness and/or Agility to determine other factors which are specific to that setting (like the chances of successfully opening a chest or avoiding a dangerous trap).</p>

      <h4>CHARISMA</h4>

      <p>Charisma is a combination of the character's physical attractiveness and personality. Charisma can often affect how the citizens and other beings on Planet Eamon will react to the character.</p>

      <p>For example, some merchants may offer slightly better prices to a likable character with a high Charisma than they will to a character with an average or low Charisma. While on an adventure, a character's Charisma also affects whether some creatures will choosing to attack, ignore, or become friends with the character. The more friends a character has in an adventure, the more help they have during battles.</p>

      <p>The actual percentage adjustment that Charisma has upon the decisions of others (or "Charisma Factor") is figured out by subtracting ten from the character's Charisma and then multiplying the difference by two.</p>

      <p>For example: The smelly hermit from the Beginner's Cave has a base friendliness of 50%. This means that Joe Normal with a charisma of ten will get to make friends with the hermit 50% of the time. However, Hedric the Horrible (with his Charisma of five), has only a 40% chance of making friends with the hermit. Lovable Linda, with a maximum charisma of twenty four has a 78% chance of making friends.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Joe Normal: (10 - 10 = 0, 0 x 2 = 0). 50% + 0% = 50%.</li>
        <li>Hedric the Horrible: (5 - 10 = -5, -5 x 2 = -10). 50% + -10% = 40%.</li>
        <li>Lovable Linda: (24 - 10 = 14, 14 x 2 = 28). 50% + 28% = 78%.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Many of the beings encountered on adventures, however, will have a pre-set friendliness factor and thus react the same regardless of your character's Charisma. A rat with a friendliness rating of 0% will never be a friend, be it with Joe Normal, Hedric the Horrible, or Lovable Linda; likewise, a fellow adventurer with a friendliness rating of 100% will always become a friend to your character.</p>

      <h3>Weapon Types and Character Weapon Abilities</h3>

      <p>Being a rough and violent world, combat is often an important aspect of Eamon. In most adventures, combat is taken care of on a blow-by-blow basis: Every combatant in the room gets one turn to attack one enemy, the effects of that attack are calculated, and the result (hit or miss) is applied.</p>

      <h4>Weapon abilities</h4>

      <p>Weapons are divided into several categories:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Axes</strong> (and other "chopping" type weapons</li>
        <li><strong>Bows</strong> and projectile weapons (everything from a standard archery set to a machine gun)</li>
        <li><strong>Clubs</strong> and other blunt crushing weapons like maces, flails, and baseball bats</li>
        <li><strong>Spears</strong> and other polearm weapons like halberds</li>
        <li><strong>Swords</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Additionally, some non-player characters and monsters may have "natural weapons" (claws, teeth, fire breath, poison ooze, etc.) or may have no weapon at all.</p>

      <p>Each player will have a different skill with each of the five weapon types. These skills increase when the player lands a successful hit, with the chances of an increase being greater with a lower chance of hitting. If Hedric the Horrible is wielding an axe, and has a 60% chance to hit, when he lands a successful blow, he has a 40% chance of gaining a 2% increase in his "axe" ability. The next round, his chance to hit would be 62%, and he would have a 38% chance to improve his ability by another 2%.</p>

      <p>For simplicity, NPCs are assumed to have the same ability with any type of weapon.</p>

      <h4>Armor Types and Armor Expertise</h4>

      <p>Eamon features several different types of armor: leather, chain, plate, and even some magic armors. Each provides a different amount of protection. Each also has a penalty for the wearer. Armor is cumbersome, and wearing heavy armor can make it harder for the character to hit an opponent. This effect diminishes with practice, as the character gains "armor expertise." Armor expertise increases the same way as weapon abilities do. However, it is limited by the type of armor worn. For example, wearing leather armor without a shield, a character's armor expertise will never increase above 10%.</p>

      <p>The "to hit penalty" here reflects a new character with an Armor Expertise of zero. As the character becomes used to the constricting effects of fighting and maneuvering while wearing armor, their increased Armor Expertise will reduce the adjustment until, finally, armor has no negative effects at all.</p>

      <p>The "Armor Expertise Required" column here reflects the amount of armor expertise the player must have to completely eliminate the penalty. Numbers lower than this will result in a partial reduction in the penalty. Numbers higher than this will never increase your chance to hit.</p>

      <p>A character's Armor Expertise ability is developed the same way as their weapon abilities: Every time they successfully strike an opponent in combat, 1D65 is rolled. If the result is larger than the odds adjustment of their armor versus their current Armor Expertise, their ability is increased by 2%. Armor Expertise will continue to increase until it reaches the maximum limit of 65%, whereupon any type of standard armor can be worn without negative effects.</p>

      <p>The standard armor types and their combat penalties are:</p>

      <table class="table">
        <tr>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>Hits Absorbed</th>
          <th>To Hit Penalty</th>
          <th>Armor Expertise Required*</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>None</td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>0%</td>
          <td>0%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Shield *</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>1%</td>
          <td>5%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Leather Armor</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>4%</td>
          <td>10%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Chain Mail</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>16%</td>
          <td>20%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Plate Armor</td>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>36%</td>
          <td>60%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Magic Armor</td>
          <td>varies</td>
          <td>varies</td>
          <td>varies</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>* A shield may be used in addition to armor, if the character is using a one-handed weapon. This means a character with plate armor and a shield would have protection from 6 hits, and would need an armor expertise of 65% to avoid the penalty.</p>

      <h3>Combat</h3>

      <h4>Attacking an oppponent</h4>

      <p>When one character or monster attacks another, there are several factors that go into calculating the hit or miss:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Attacker's agility</li>
        <li>Defender's agility</li>
        <li>Attacker's armor class</li>
        <li>Defenders's armor class</li>
        <li>Weapon ability</li>
        <li>Weapon odds</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each individual weapon has its own odds adjustment, also known as "weapon odds" or "weapon complexity". This number reflects the quality of the weapon and how hard it is to use properly. A magic bow may increase your chance to hit, while a poorly-made sword may decrease it.</p>

      <p>Armor also affects the odds of one opponent striking another in combat (after all, one just isn't as agile when fighting from within a tin can!).</p>

      <p>The amount of damage a weapon does is determined by two factors: the weapon's damage "dice" and "sides." In traditional RPGs, these would indicate the number and type of dice the player would roll to calculate the damage. For example, if your character's weapon has a damage rating of 2d8, you would roll two 8-sided dice and add the total. In Eamon, however, it's a computer that does the rolling. So, you may see unusual dice like d5 or d7, and this is perfectly normal.</p>

      <p>Once the initial damage is calculated, it is then adjusted based on the defender's armor class. So, if a player wearing chain mail is hit for 5 points of damage, the chain mail absorbs 2 points, leaving a final damage of 3 hit points.</p>

      <h3>Magic</h3>

      <p>The strange shifting forces around Planet Eamon constantly create effects that can only be described as magical. However, most of these effects are extremely localized to a particular adventure setting and will not be consistent from one foray to the next.</p>

      <p>Any character can pay a knowledgeable wizard to teach them these spells at a starting level. When they first learn a spell, a 1D100 die will be rolled and they will start with an ability level ranging from 25% to 75%. For additional money, the wizard can teach the character more advanced techniques, improving their spell ability further.</p>

      <p>There are four common spells that work almost everywhere:</p>

      <h4>BLAST</h4>

      <p>This spell can be used by your character to send a magical blast of pure energy at either an opponent or an item (such as locked doors or chests). If successfully cast, a BLAST spell will always hit its target and do 1D6 in damage. Also, if the target is a living being, armor will not help absorb any of the damage from a BLAST spell.</p>

      <h4>HEAL</h4>

      <p>This spell can be used to remove damage points from either the character casting it or any other living creature (in effect, "healing" them). If successfully cast, a HEAL spell will remove 1D10 in damage points from its target.</p>

      <p>To heal yourself, just type "HEAL" into the command prompt. To heal a friend, type "HEAL {name}", e.g. "HEAL EDDIE".</p>

      <h4>SPEED</h4>

      <p>If successfully cast, a SPEED spell will double your character's agility for a random amount of time (ranging from eleven to twenty turns). If a SPEED spell is cast successfully while another one is already in effect, the new spell will increase the amount of rounds left, but it will not have the effect of further multiplying a character's agility. The SPEED spell is mostly useful when a character is engaged in combat with a skilled opponent, has a long paper to write within a short amount of time, or needs to study for an exam.</p>

      <h4>POWER</h4>

      <p>POWER is a unique and unpredictable spell, influenced greatly by the shifting forces of the world of Eamon. It's basically a call to the magical forces around your character that says, "Hey, do something!"</p>

      <p>Depending upon the adventure your character is on, successfully casting POWER may cause a harmless diversion or have powerful effects (both helpful and harmful in nature). In some adventures, Power will do little more than make a loud noise, while in others it may be the key to surviving or moving on to different points in the game. If you become totally stuck (or just feel daring), give POWER a try.</p>

      <h4>Spell Abilities</h4>

      <p>As with combat abilities, there is a chance that each spell ability can be increased every time your character successfully casts that spell; if a 1D100 dice roll is less than their chance to not have cast it, their ability will increase by 2% until they reach the 100% natural limit.</p>

      <p>For example: Hedric has now learned the BLAST spell and been given a starting ability of 30%. If he successfully casts the spell and a 1D100 roll yields a result from one to seventy, his overall ability for that spell will increase to 32%, with a roll from one to sixty eight being required for the next increase.</p>

      <h4>Additional Factors</h4>

      <p>There are also "wildcard" rolls involved in spell casting: A roll from one to five will always be successful and a roll of one hundred will overload your character's mind and they will not be able to cast that spell for the rest of the adventure.</p>

      <p>Due to the tiring effects of sending supernatural powers through their body, every time your character attempts to cast a spell (regardless of whether or not they succeed) their next chance is reduced by half until they "rest up" their brain for a bit. <!-- The STATUS command can be used to see the actual values of their current spell abilities as well as their overall spell abilities among other useful information. --></p>

      <p>Note that this is the way that the four common spells usually work. Eamon is a marvelous and very random world and spell abilities may not drop at all when your character uses them in some adventures, while in other places spells may work quite differently or sometimes not at all.</p>

      <h4>Special Spells</h4>

      <p>Due to the chaotic nature of the world of Eamon, some adventures may have additional spells available. Look for magic inscriptions or spell books to learn these. Unlike the standard spells, these will not work in any other adventure besides the one where they're found!</p>
