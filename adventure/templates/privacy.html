        <h2><img src="{% static "images/ravenmore/128/shield.png" %}"> Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected and used by Eamon
          Remastered when you access the game's website, eamon-remastered.com ("Site").</p>
        <h3>Collection of Information</h3>
        <p>Eamon Remastered collects the following information during use of the Site:</p>
        <p><strong>Analytics information:</strong> Eamon Remastered may log information about your
          use of the Site, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, and
          the page you visited before navigating to its website (the "referrer"). Eamon Remastered
          collects an anonymized version of your IP address that cannot be used to identify you
          personally.</p>
        <p><strong>Game Log information:</strong> Eamon Remastered logs general statistical
          information about the game play. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
          loading and saving characters, number of adventures played, and game achievements such as
          the number of secret doors found during game play.</p>
        <p><strong>Social Login ID:</strong> When you use the "Login with Facebook" feature, Eamon
          Remastered collects a Social Login ID provided by Facebook. Eamon Remastered uses the
          Social Login ID to identify you across different browsers and computers. This allows you
          to play with the same characters on all devices. If you do not wish to allow Eamon
          Remastered to store your Social Login ID, do not use the "Login with Facebook" feature.
          Other features of the site will still function.</p>
        <h3>Use of Information</h3>
        <p>Eamon Remastered may use the information collected for several purposes, including the
          following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining and improving the Site</li>
          <li>Viewing aggregate traffic and referral trends</li>
          <li>Identifying your computer and browser to allow you to use the same characters across
            multiple sessions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Eamon Remastered is based in the United States, and the data is stored on servers located
          in the U.S. The information we collect is governed by U.S. law. By accessing or using the
          Site or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer
          of information in and to the U.S.</p>
        <p>Eamon Remastered does not host any advertising and does not share your information with
          any third parties, except for analytics purposes and as required by law.</p>
        <h3>Tracking &amp; Cookies Data</h3>
        <p>Eamon Remastered uses a third party service to collect analytics data. This data is used
          to generate aggregate reports about the use of the Site. The analytics service may place
          tracking cookies and similar technologies to track the activity on the Site.</p>
        <p>Eamon Remastered stores an anonymous identification code in your browser's Local Storage.
          This is used to &quot;remember&quot; your characters when you return to the site in a later
          session. This feature is integral to the functioning of the Site. If you do not wish to
          allow this data to be set in your browser, you must discontinue use of the Site.</p>
